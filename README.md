### This repository is only for the purpose of posting my revised copy of Steve Pomeroy's original.

I revised Steve's large diagram to include only the Activity portion and formatted it for letter size one-page printout. I've posted it here as a text PDF.

Please see https://github.com/xxv/android-lifecycle for the origin of this project.
